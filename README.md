# How to Crash an Oppressive Algorithm

## My Overall Provocation

Algorithmic harm cannot be resolved through better data or reform alone; when AI systems are built on extractive, Western epistemologies, refusal and disruption become necessary practices for Indigenous data sovereignty and liberation.

## Project Description

*How to Crash an Oppressive Algorithm* is a critical, pedagogical project that examines how AI systems extract knowledge, govern life, and reproduce colonial power structures under the guise of neutrality and efficiency. As predictive models, computer vision systems, and large language models increasingly shape policy decisions and living conditions, Indigenous lands, languages, and ways of knowing are rendered legible within systems that were never designed to hold them (their multitudinous). My work argues that inclusion within such systems often deepens dispossession rather than addressing harm.

My project operates across three interrelated components: a series of browser-based games, a conceptual booklet, and an open-source archive. Together, these elements teach how extractive AI systems function and how they might be challenged, disrupted, or refused. Rather than proposing technical fixes or optimization strategies, my work centers hacktivism as an ethical and collective practice of resistance, oriented towards Indigenous data sovereignty, autonomy, and liberation from extractive algorithmic infrastructures.

## Computational Methods

My computational approach centers on game design and hacking as both a literal practice and a framework for Indigenous data liberation. The goal is to make hacking approachable, reframing it as a set of skills and tactics for intervening in extractive computational systems rather than a domain reserved for technical experts.

The browser-based games are designed not only to teach participants about data extractivism, but to place them directly inside the act of disrupting the systems that sustain it. Responding to feedback from the review, the project moves beyond pedagogical simulation by requiring players to actively intervene in and produce hacks within the game environment, rather than merely observing algorithmic processes. 

The archive component functions as an open-source repository designed to teach participants and provide them with tools to become more fully engaged with hacking and hacktivism. It organizes techniques, texts, and practices around intervention, lowering the barrier to entry for those without formal technical training. Rather than privileging mastery or efficiency, the workflows emphasize experimentation, failure, and opacity as pedagogical strategies, positioning it as a site of learning and resistance.

## Design Methods

The design approach of this project is critical, pedagogical, decolonizing, and participatory. By using play, narrative, and interaction, my work reframes hacking and hacktivism as accessible political practices rather than elite technical skills. The game format allows participants to learn through experimentation, failure, and disruption, making abstract concepts like data extractivism tangible and experiential.

The booklet functions as a conceptual guide, situating algorithmic systems within broader histories of colonialism, land extraction, and governance. The archive supports ongoing collective learning, emphasizing ethical engagement over exploitation. Across all components, the design method rejects optimization and reform in favor of refusal, disruption, and collective action, positioning design itself as a site of political intervention.

## Precedents

### Molleindustria (Inspo for Games as a Pedagogical/Interactive Approach)

Molleindustria’s body of work demonstrates how games can function as critical and educational tools rather than entertainment alone. Their projects expose political and economic systems through mechanics that encourage reflection and critique. This project builds on Molleindustria’s approach by using gameplay to make algorithmic power legible, while extending it toward questions of Indigenous data sovereignty and refusal.

### Sam Lavigne & Tega Brain *How to Get to Zero* (Inspo for Multimedia approach)

*How to Get to Zero* is important to this project because it shows how interactive and multimedia formats can make complex political and environmental issues more engaging and approachable. By combining text, data, and interactive elements, the project invites people to explore extractive systems in a way that feels participatory rather than instructional. I am drawn to this work not only for its critical perspective, but because it is genuinely fun to interact with.

## Audience

The primary audience for this project includes Indigenous peoples, students, designers, artists, technologists, and researchers interested in AI, critical technology studies, and Indigenous data sovereignty. The project is designed to be accessible to participants without advanced technical expertise, emphasizing learning through play and narrative. However, I also recognize that this project may exclude audiences without reliable internet access or familiarity with digital interfaces. Future iterations could include offline versions, community-led workshops, or adaptations for Indigenous youth education to broaden accessibility and inclusivity.
