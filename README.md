# How to Crash an Oppressive Algorithm

## My Overall Provocation

Algorithmic harm cannot be resolved through better data or reform alone; when AI systems are built on extractive, Western epistemologies, refusal and disruption become necessary practices for Indigenous data sovereignty.

## Project Description

*How to Crash an Oppressive Algorithm* is a critical, pedagogical project that examines how AI systems extract knowledge, govern life, and reproduce colonial power structures under the guise of neutrality and efficiency. As predictive models, computer vision systems, and large language models increasingly shape policy decisions and material conditions, Indigenous lands, languages, and ways of knowing are rendered legible within systems that were never designed to hold them. This project argues that inclusion within such systems often deepens dispossession rather than addressing harm.

My project operates across three interrelated components: a series of browser-based games, a conceptual booklet, and an open-source archive. Together, these elements teach how extractive AI systems function and how they might be challenged, disrupted, or refused. Rather than proposing technical fixes or optimization strategies, my work centers hacktivism as an ethical and collective practice of resistance, oriented towards Indigenous data sovereignty, autonomy, and liberation from extractive algorithmic infrastructures.

## Computational Methods

The browser-based games are designed not only to teach participants about data extractivism, but to place them directly inside the act of hacking the systems that sustain it. In response to feedback given at the review, my project moves beyond a purely pedagogical simulation by requiring players to actively intervene in and produce hacks within the game environment, rather than simply observing or learning about algorithmic processes.

This project uses computational methods not to optimize or improve AI systems, but to expose their assumptions, vulnerabilities, and political consequences through game design and speculative hacking practices. The browser-based games simulate algorithmic processes such as data training, classification, and prediction, while allowing players to actively produce hacks within the system. These hacks take the form of disruptive in-game interventions, including popup worms that replicate and obstruct interfaces, glitching data clouds that contaminate training sets, and cascading errors that propagate through algorithmic pipelines.

The archive component operates as an open-source computational infrastructure, organizing tools, texts, and practices related to hacktivism and refusal. Rather than privileging those with high technical skills, the computational workflows emphasize misuse, failure, and opacity as pedagogical affordances. Computation here becomes a site of learning and resistance, demonstrating how algorithmic systems can be confronted rather than refined.

## Design Methods

The design approach of this project is critical, pedagogical, decolonizing, and participatory. By using play, narrative, and interaction, my work reframes hacking and hacktivism as accessible political practices rather than elite technical skills. The game format allows participants to learn through experimentation, failure, and disruption, making abstract concepts like data extractivism tangible and experiential.

The booklet functions as a conceptual guide, situating algorithmic systems within broader histories of colonialism, land extraction, and governance. The archive supports ongoing collective learning, emphasizing ethical engagement over exploitation. Across all components, the design method rejects optimization and reform in favor of refusal, disruption, and collective action, positioning design itself as a site of political intervention.

## Precedents

### Molleindustria (Inspo for Games as a Pedagogical/Interactive Approach)

Molleindustria’s body of work demonstrates how games can function as critical and educational tools rather than entertainment alone. Their projects expose political and economic systems through mechanics that encourage reflection and critique. This project builds on Molleindustria’s pedagogical approach by using gameplay to make algorithmic power legible, while extending it toward questions of Indigenous data sovereignty and refusal rather than critique alone.

### Sam Lavigne & Tega Brain – *How to Get to Zero* (Inspo for Multimedia approach)

*How to Get to Zero* is important to this project because it shows how interactive and multimedia formats can make complex political and environmental issues more engaging and approachable. By combining text, data, and interactive elements, the project invites people to explore extractive systems in a way that feels participatory rather than instructional. I am drawn to this work not only for its critical perspective, but because it is genuinely fun to interact with.

## Audience

The primary audience for this project includes Indigenous peoples, students, designers, artists, technologists, and researchers interested in AI, critical technology studies, and Indigenous data sovereignty. The project is designed to be accessible to participants without advanced technical expertise, emphasizing learning through play and narrative. However, I also recognize that this project may exclude audiences without reliable internet access or familiarity with digital interfaces. Future iterations could include offline versions, community-led workshops, or adaptations for Indigenous youth education to broaden accessibility and inclusivity.
